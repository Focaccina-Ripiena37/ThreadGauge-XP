## üìñ Overview

ThreadGauge XP is a lightweight desktop application that helps developers and system administrators understand Java thread behavior, memory consumption, and system limits. Built with **Java 21 LTS** and **Swing**, it features a nostalgic Windows XP-inspired user interface while providing powerful thread analysis capabilities.

### Key Features

- **Max Thread Discovery**: Empirically find the maximum number of threads your system can handle
- **Memory Estimation**: Calculate per-thread memory consumption with configurable stack sizes
- **Stress Testing**: Run controlled load tests with customizable thread counts and durations
- **Live Telemetry**: Real-time monitoring of active threads, heap usage, and CPU load
- **Export Results**: Save test results to TXT or CSV format for analysis
- **Safe Operation**: Built-in safety caps and graceful error handling (OutOfMemoryError, interruptions)
- **Classic XP UI**: Tahoma fonts, soft blue color palette, and familiar Windows XP styling

## üéØ What It Does

ThreadGauge XP helps answer questions like:

- How many threads can my JVM create before hitting system limits?
- How much memory does each thread consume with different stack sizes?
- What happens to CPU load under thread stress?
- How do different JVM configurations affect thread capacity?

The app is designed for:
- **Java developers** optimizing multi-threaded applications
- **System administrators** capacity planning for Java deployments
- **Educators** teaching concurrency concepts
- **Researchers** studying JVM behavior across platforms

---

## üìã Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 LTS** or later
  - Download from: [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/25/)
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **No additional dependencies** - uses only standard JDK libraries

### Verify Java Installation

```bash
java -version
```

Expected output should show Java 21 or higher:
```
java version "21" 2023-09-19
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 21+35)
```

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Run with Gradle Wrapper (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone or download the repository
git clone https://github.com/Focaccina-Ripiena37/ThreadGauge-XP.git
cd ThreadGauge-XP

# Build
.\gradlew.bat clean build

# Build and run (Unix/macOS/Linux)
./gradlew run

# Build and run (Windows)
.\gradlew.bat run

# Verify Java in use by Gradle (should resolve/download JDK 21 automatically)
.\gradlew.bat -version
```

### Option 2: Build JAR and Run

```bash
# Build the executable JAR
./gradlew clean build

# Run the JAR
java -jar build/libs/ThreadGauge-XP.jar
```

### Option 3: Run from IDE

1. Import the project into your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)
2. Ensure Java 21 toolchain is configured
3. Run the main class: `dev.threadgaugexp.MainWindow`

---

## üîß Build Instructions

### Building from Source

The project uses Gradle with the **Gradle Wrapper**, so you don't need Gradle pre-installed.

```bash
# Clean and build
./gradlew clean build

# (Tests removed)
No unit tests are shipped in this release build.

# Create distribution
./gradlew jar
```

The compiled JAR will be located at:
```
build/libs/ThreadGauge-XP.jar
```

### Manual Compilation (without Gradle)

If you prefer to compile manually:

```bash
# Create output directory
mkdir -p build/classes

# Compile all Java files
javac -d build/classes \
   --release 21 \
  $(find src/main/java -name "*.java")

# Create JAR with manifest
jar cfe build/libs/ThreadGauge-XP.jar \
  dev.threadgaugexp.MainWindow \
  -C build/classes .

# Run
java -jar build/libs/ThreadGauge-XP.jar
```

## üì± User Interface Guide

### System Information Panel (Top)
- Displays OS, JVM (App) version + implementation (HotSpot/OpenJ9/GraalVM), CPU cores, physical RAM (total/free), and System Java (dal PATH, se abilitata)
- Updates on startup

### Controls Panel (Middle Left)
- **Stack Size**: Configure thread stack size (128 KB - 8192 KB)
- **Find Max Threads**: Start maximum thread discovery test
- **Stress Threads/Duration**: Configure stress test parameters
- **Run Stress Test**: Execute controlled load test
- **Stop Test**: Cancel running test (graceful shutdown)
- **Export Results**: Save test data to file

### Telemetry Panel (Middle Right)
- **Active Threads**: Current approximate JVM thread count (updates every 500ms)
- **Heap Used/Committed/Max**: JVM heap usage; progress shows used/max and used/committed
- **CPU Load**: System CPU usage with visual indicator
- Color-coded warnings (green ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí red based on usage)

### Output Log (Bottom)
- Timestamped event log
- Test results and error messages
- Clear Log button for cleanup

### Status Bar (Bottom)
- Shows current application state
- "Ready" when idle, descriptive messages during tests

---

## üß™ Usage Examples

### Finding Maximum Threads

1. Set desired **Stack Size** (default: 512 KB)
2. Click **Find Max Threads**
3. Wait for test to complete (may take 1-3 minutes)
4. Results show:
   - Maximum thread count reached
   - Memory per thread estimate
   - Stop reason (safety cap, memory limit, etc.)

**Note**: The test respects safety caps (50,000 threads) and stops when free heap drops below 50 MB.

### Running a Stress Test

1. Configure:
   - **Stress Threads**: Number of worker threads (10-10,000)
   - **Duration**: Test length in seconds (1-60)
2. Click **Run Stress Test**
3. Monitor CPU and memory in real-time
4. Results show:
   - Actual duration
   - Average CPU load during test
   - Thread lifecycle stats

### Exporting Results

1. Click **Export Results**
2. Choose format:
   - **TXT**: Detailed report with full log
   - **CSV**: Structured data for spreadsheet analysis
3. Select save location
4. File contains:
   - System information
   - Test parameters
   - Results and metrics
   - Timestamp

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

ThreadGauge XP includes multiple safety mechanisms:

1. **Upper Bounds**
   - 50,000 thread safety cap (configurable in code)
   - Minimum free heap threshold (50 MB)

2. **Error Handling**
   - Catches `OutOfMemoryError` gracefully
   - Handles `StackOverflowError` without crashing
   - Continues operation after test failures

3. **Cancellation**
   - All tests can be stopped mid-execution
   - Threads are interrupted cleanly
   - Partial results are reported

4. **Non-Blocking UI**
   - All tests run in background workers (`SwingWorker`)
   - UI remains responsive during tests
   - Progress indicators show activity

## üìä Understanding Results

### Max Thread Count

The maximum number of threads varies based on:
- **Stack size**: Smaller stacks ‚Üí more threads
- **Heap size**: More heap ‚Üí more threads
- **OS limits**: Windows, Linux, macOS have different caps
- **System RAM**: Physical memory constraints

**Typical ranges:**
- Small stack (128 KB): 10,000 - 50,000+ threads
- Default stack (512 KB - 1 MB): 5,000 - 20,000 threads
- Large stack (2+ MB): 1,000 - 5,000 threads

### Memory Per Thread

Includes:
- Thread object overhead (~1 KB)
- Stack size (as configured)
- JVM internal structures

**Example**: With 512 KB stack, expect ~520-550 KB per thread.

### CPU Load

- **0-30%**: Light load, normal operation
- **30-60%**: Moderate load, efficient threading
- **60-80%**: Heavy load, potential contention
- **80-100%**: Maximum load, possible thrashing

---

## üîç Technical Details

### Threading Model

- **Test Threads**: Minimal `Runnable` with sleep loop
- **Background Execution**: `SwingWorker` for non-blocking tests
- **Interruption**: Cooperative cancellation via interrupt flags
- **Cleanup**: All threads joined/terminated after tests

### Memory Measurement

1. Force garbage collection (`System.gc()`)
2. Wait for GC to stabilize (100-200ms)
3. Record heap usage before thread creation
4. Create N threads
5. Record heap usage after creation
6. Calculate delta: `(after - before) / N`

**Limitations**: GC timing is not guaranteed; results are estimates.

### CPU Monitoring

Uses `com.sun.management.OperatingSystemMXBean`:
- `getCpuLoad()`: System-wide CPU usage (0.0 - 1.0)
- Sampled every 500ms
- May not be available on all platforms (shows "N/A")
